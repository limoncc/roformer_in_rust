#### sentence2vector in rust

Use rust to deploy the RoFormer sentence vector model, which is a further step of the [**ai_run_in_rust**](https://github.com/limoncc/ai_run_in_rust) project: 
 
1. Solve the problem of Bert model token coding 
2. Solved the problem that there was no batch encode for token encoding 
3. This allows you to deploy a model service with no python environment dependencies using the methods in [**ai_run_in_rust**](https://github.com/limoncc/ai_run_in_rust) 

There should be another project to deploy UIE or Baichuan2 models so that rust models can be deployed in action.
